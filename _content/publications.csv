Smoot, Hoon Hur, Byong Chul Yoo, Jae Youl Cho",2020-05-02,Molecular Signatures of JMJD10/MINA53 in Gastric Cancer,"The JMJD10 gene and its encoded protein MYC-induced nuclear antigen (MINA53) are associated with multiple cancers. Besides having both an oncogenic and tumor suppressor function, the intricate role of JMJD10 in cancer is complex as it depends on the cancer type. In particular, the functional role of JMJD10/MINA53 in gastric cancer has been poorly understood. In this study, we have unraveled the molecular signatures and functional roles of JMJD10/MINA53 in gastric cancer by multiple approaches, i.e., multi-omics bioinformatics study, analysis of human gastric cancer tissues, and studies in vitro using knockdown or overexpression strategies in gastric cancer cell lines. The results indicated that the JMJD10 gene and MINA53 protein are commonly overexpressed in cancer patients. JMJD10/MINA53 is involved in the regulation of proliferation and survival of gastric cancer by controlling cell cycle gene expression. These processes are highly associated with MINA53 enzymatic activity in the regulation of H3K9me3 methylation status and controlling activation of AP-1 signaling pathways. This highlights the oncogenic role of JMJD10/MINA53 in gastric cancer and opens the opportunity to develop therapeutic targeting of JMJD10/MINA53 in gastric cancer.",tldr,Cancers,Cancers,,Cancers,NA,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/12/5/1141/pdf?version=1590490889,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/12/5/1141/pdf?version=1590490889,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,bibtex,y,y,y,NA,NA,y,NA,NA

A daidzein derivative compound, 8-hydroxydaidzein (8-HD), isolated from soy products, has recently gained attention due to various pharmacological benefits, including anti-inflammatory activities. However, regulation of the inflammatory signaling mechanism for 8-HD is still poorly understood, particularly with respect to the IRF-3 signaling pathway. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of 8-HD in regulating inflammatory processes, with a focus on the IRF-3 signaling pathway using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] stimulated murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7). The 8-HD downregulated the mRNA expression level of IRF-3-dependent genes by inhibiting phosphorylation of the IRF-3 transcription factor. The inhibitory mechanism of 8-HD in the IRF-3 signaling pathway was shown to inhibit the kinase activity of IKK&epsilon; to phosphorylate IRF-3. This compound can also interfere with the TRIF-mediated complex formation composed of TRAF3, TANK, and IKK&epsilon; leading to downregulation of AKT phosphorylation and reduction of IRF-3 activation, resulted in inhibition of IRF-3-dependent expression of genes including IFN-&beta;, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1). Therefore, these results strongly suggest that 8-HD can act as a promising compound with the regulatory function of IRF-3-mediated inflammatory responses.",tldr,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,,Biomolecules,NA,https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/2/238/pdf?version=1580982364,https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/2/238/pdf?version=1580982364,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,bibtex,y,y,y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
NA,Research Article,"Nur Aziz, Young-Jin Son, Jae Youl Cho",2018-05-03,Thymoquinone Suppresses IRF-3-Mediated Expression of Type I Interferons via Suppression of TBK1,"Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 is known to have a critical role in viral and bacterial innate immune responses by regulating the production of type I interferon (IFN). Thymoquinone (TQ) is a compound derived from black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) and is known to regulate immune responses by affecting transcription factors associated with inflammation, including nuclear factor-&kappa;B (NF-&kappa;B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). However, the role of TQ in the IRF-3 signaling pathway has not been elucidated. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism of TQ-dependent regulation of enzymes in IRF-3 signaling pathways using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cell line. TQ decreased mRNA expression of the interferon genes IFN-&alpha; and IFN-&beta; in these cells. This inhibition was due to its suppression of the transcriptional activation of IRF-3, as shown by inhibition of IRF-3 PRD (III-I) luciferase activity as well as the phosphorylation pattern of IRF-3 in the immunoblotting experiment. Moreover, TQ targeted the autophosphorylation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), an upstream key enzyme responsible for IRF-3 activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that TQ can downregulate IRF-3 activation via inhibition of TBK1, which would subsequently decrease the production of type I IFN. TQ also regulated IRF-3, one of the inflammatory transcription factors, providing a novel insight into its anti-inflammatory activities.",tldr,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,Int. J. Mol.

Plants with a high luteolin content have been used ethnopharmacologically to treat inflammation-related ",tldr,Journal of Ethnopharmacology,J Ethnopharmacol,,Journal of Ethnopharmacology,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.05.019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.05.019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,"symptoms. Both isolated luteolin and extracts from luteolin-rich plants have been studied using various models and exhibited anti-inflammatory activity. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This paper uses recent research findings with a broad range of study models to describe the anti-inflammatory activity of luteolin, particularly its mechanisms at the molecular level; provide guidance for future research; and evaluate the feasibility of developing luteolin into an anti-inflammatory drug. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We summarize reports about the anti-inflammatory activity of luteolin published since 2009, which we found in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. To acquire broad information, we extended our search to online FDA documents. RESULTS: Luteolin is a flavonoid commonly found in medicinal plants and has strong anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo. Some of its derivatives, such as luteolin-7-O-glucoside, have also shown anti-inflammatory activity. The action mechanism of luteolin varies, but Src in the nuclear factor (NF)-?B pathway, MAPK in the activator protein (AP)-?1 pathway, and SOCS3 in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway are its major target transcription factors. A clinical trial with a formulation containing luteolin showed excellent therapeutic effect against inflammation-associated diseases. CONCLUSION: In silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies strongly suggest that the major pharmacological mechanism of luteolin is its anti-inflammatory activity, which derives from its regulation of transcription factors such as STAT3, NF-?B, and AP-1. Much work remains to ensure the safety, quality, and efficacy of luteolin before it can be used to treat inflammation-related diseases in humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
