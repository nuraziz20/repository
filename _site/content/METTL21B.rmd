* Here I documented the codes I used to make graph/figuring for EEF1AKMT3 paper published in [Cancer Letters](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2022.215803).
* Unfortunately, the graph did not look so good on the published one because it was compressed by Ms. Word. 
* These are the codes just for figuring. Data analysis was both performed in Ms. Excel and R. Don't get confused.
